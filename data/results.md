Pitt County, North Carolina: Baseline Eviction Patterns
Analysis of court-issued eviction filings in Pitt County, North Carolina reveals a relatively stable pattern of eviction activity across the study period. Annual filing counts fluctuate modestly year to year, but no sustained upward or downward trend is observed. This stability suggests that eviction pressure in Pitt County is largely structural rather than episodic, reflecting ongoing housing market conditions rather than acute external shocks.
The absence of sharp spikes or discontinuities in the Pitt County time series supports its use as a baseline jurisdiction. Eviction activity appears persistent but contained, providing a useful reference point against which more volatile or shock-affected counties can be compared.
Bay County, Florida: Disaster-Related Structural Shift

In contrast, Bay County, Florida exhibits a clear structural shift in eviction filing patterns when segmented by disaster period. When eviction filings are grouped into pre-disaster (prior to 2018) and post-disaster (2018 and later) periods, mean eviction filings increase in the post-disaster period.
This pattern aligns temporally with Hurricane Michael, which made landfall in Bay County in October 2018 and caused widespread housing damage and displacement. The observed increase in eviction filings following the disaster suggests that housing instability persisted beyond the immediate emergency response phase and into longer-term recovery.

#Comparative Interpretation
The contrast between Pitt County and Bay County highlights the importance of contextual segmentation in eviction monitoring. While Pitt County demonstrates relatively stable eviction activity over time, Bay County shows a marked post-disaster elevation that would be obscured if analyzed without temporal segmentation.
These findings demonstrate that eviction risk is not solely a function of baseline housing market conditions, but can be significantly altered by external shocks such as natural disasters. Importantly, this shift is detectable using aggregate, publicly available court data without reliance on individual-level records or predictive modeling.

#Implications for Early Warning Systems
The results validate the core premise of the early warning framework: meaningful eviction risk signals can be identified through transparent temporal comparison rather than complex prediction. By comparing observed filings to historical baselines and incorporating disaster-period segmentation, jurisdictions can detect emerging housing instability in near real time.
This approach is particularly well suited for regulatory agencies, housing advocates, and policymakers who require interpretable signals that can be audited, explained, and acted upon without specialized technical expertise.
