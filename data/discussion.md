Discussion
The findings from this analysis underscore the value of transparent, jurisdiction-sensitive approaches to eviction monitoring. By comparing a stable baseline county with a disaster-impacted county, this study demonstrates that eviction pressure is not uniform across contexts and that external shocks can produce sustained structural effects detectable through aggregate court data.
The relative stability observed in Pitt County suggests that eviction filings in non-disaster contexts may function as a steady indicator of underlying housing market conditions, such as affordability constraints, wage stagnation, or limited rental supply. In such jurisdictions, fluctuations in eviction activity appear incremental rather than episodic, reinforcing the need for long-term structural interventions rather than short-term emergency responses.
In contrast, the post-disaster elevation in eviction filings observed in Bay County highlights how disasters can alter housing stability well beyond the immediate recovery phase. While emergency housing responses often focus on temporary displacement and rebuilding, the persistence of elevated eviction filings suggests that legal and economic vulnerabilities emerge or intensify as recovery resources taper. This pattern aligns with prior research indicating that disaster recovery timelines frequently outlast formal relief programs, leaving renters exposed to enforcement mechanisms once moratoria expire or informal protections lapse.
Importantly, the analytical framework used here demonstrates that such patterns can be identified without reliance on individual-level data or predictive modeling. Instead, simple temporal segmentation and baseline comparison reveal actionable signals that can inform policy oversight. For regulatory agencies, this approach offers a defensible method for identifying jurisdictions where eviction dynamics warrant closer scrutiny, targeted intervention, or coordination with housing and disaster recovery agencies.
The contrast between counties also illustrates the risk of aggregating eviction data without contextual markers. Absent disaster-period segmentation, Bay County’s post-hurricane increase could be misinterpreted as normal variance rather than a structural shift. This finding has direct implications for how eviction data are reported, interpreted, and operationalized in policy settings, particularly when used to allocate resources or trigger enforcement reviews.
From a practice perspective, these results support the use of early warning systems that emphasize interpretability and auditability. Housing stability interventions often require coordination across agencies with differing mandates and levels of technical capacity. Models that rely on opaque prediction or complex feature engineering may hinder adoption, whereas transparent signals grounded in observable historical patterns are more likely to be trusted and acted upon.
Finally, this study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating data science methods into housing policy analysis in a way that remains grounded in lived realities. Eviction filings are not abstract metrics; they represent households facing displacement and communities absorbing cumulative stress. By framing eviction monitoring as an early warning mechanism rather than a retrospective statistic, this approach positions data science as a tool for prevention rather than post hoc evaluation.
