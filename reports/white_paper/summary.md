# White Paper Summary (Portfolio Version)

## Problem
Evictions are often monitored after displacement occurs. This limits prevention.

## Approach
We standardize eviction filings relative to local baselines and create an interpretable early warning score.
We test replication across a non-disaster county and a disaster-recovery county.

## Key takeaway
The framework surfaces elevated pressure without parameter tuning, supporting its use as a monitoring tool.

## Ethical guardrails
No individual-level prediction. No inference of wrongdoing. Aggregate monitoring only.
